🧑‍💻 

Another ToDoList... After all, I created this project to develop and improve my basic skills in JavaScript.

## Difficulties
The project was done in one of the courses I've done. Nevertheless, I tried to recreate it by writing it from memory to assimilate the logic of creating an application.
